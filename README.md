# California Housing Prices - Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project explores housing price prediction in California using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately predict house prices based on various features such as location, number of rooms, and median income.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **California housing dataset**, which contains information on housing prices in different districts of California. It includes features like:
- Median income
- House age
- Number of rooms
- Population
- Latitude & Longitude

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training using regression algorithms
- Model evaluation with metrics such as RMSE and R²
- Hyperparameter tuning for performance improvement

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the workflow:
```bash
python housing_price_prediction.py
```
